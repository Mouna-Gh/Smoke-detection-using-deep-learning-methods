# Smoke-detection-using-deep-learning-methods
In this project we work on smoke detection in videos using deep learning methods, we use vgg16 and yolov3 as reference models and we implement a convolutional neural network which performance will be compared to that of the baseline methods.
We present the code of vgg16, yolov3 which we got from other githubs, we also give the labeling tool used on yolo's data. we add the labeled data under the darknet format.
